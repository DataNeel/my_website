Hi! My name is **Neel Shivdasani**, and I live in Atlanta, Ga.

I'm a product manager at [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com), where I work with cross-functional teams to build data science features that empower small businesses. Prior becoming a product manager, I was a data scientist. You can learn more about these sorts of things [on linkedin](http://linkedin.dataneel.com).

I also like to make generative art, which you can find [on instagram](http://instagram.dataneel.com). This hobby led me to cofound an online art gallery where buyers could customize and order unique art prints. It's called [GASP Gallery](http://www.gasp.gallery), but we've currently suspended the ability to buy prints.

You can reach out to me on [twitter](http://twitter.dataneel.com), [linkedin](http://linkedin.dataneel.com), and [instagram](http://instagram.dataneel.com). Thanks!
